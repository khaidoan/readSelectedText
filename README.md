# Purpose

HTML5 Web Speech API adds voice recognition (speech to text) and speech synthesis (text to speech) to JavaScript.  As far as I know, currently Firefox does not yet support this functionality.  However, Chrome 33 has support for text to speech and it is quite decent.  This means that we use this functionality to read a web page aloud, and we no longer have to read the screen, particularly when the lines are long, or the text is too small.  As a developer, while reading a page containing code samples, using this technogy may helps a bit for parts that does not contain code.  For parts that do contain code samples, then we still need to look at it, understand it, etc.  Otherwise, this technology should be useful for reach news articles, or parts of a page that contain long text.

# Future enhancements

1. Underline the current word or fragment somehow.
2. Improve the pronunciation of certain common abbreviations.  For examples, we probably should make it pronounce APIs as A P Eyes.
