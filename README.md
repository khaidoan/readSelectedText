# Purpose

HTML5 Web Speech API adds voice recognition (speech to text) and speech synthesis (text to speech) to JavaScript.  As far as I know, currently Firefox does not yet support this functionality.  However, Chrome 33 has support for text to speech and it is quite decent.  This means that we use this functionality to read a web page aloud, and we no longer have to read the screen, particularly when the lines are long, or the text is too small.

# Future enhancements

    Underline the current word or fragment somehow.
